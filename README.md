# Heart-Failure-Prediction

This project contains files from theme 9.

In this folder you'll find markdown files and pdf files. The markdown can be knitted to produce the pdf file, but for convenience this already has been done.

There are two files, the research log and the final report ( Heart Failure Prediction ). 
	- The research log contains all the undertaken research steps, including EDA and machine learning phases.
    - The final report which contains results, discussion etc.
	
The folder data contains csv files which are used in the Rmd files. They mostly contain algorithm performance data which is used to decide which algorithm will be used for the final model. This folder also contains png files. Those are just images for the J48 model and ROC curve.
